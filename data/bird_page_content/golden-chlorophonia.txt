A brightly coloured bird, the golden-browed chlorophonia is distinctive within its range. The male is bright green above and yellow below, with a wide golden-yellow eyebrow stripe and a violet-blue cap. It has a narrow blue eye ring and a thin blue line extending from its nape to its breast. The female is similar, but without the golden brown and yellow breast; these are both replaced with green. They average 13 cm (5.1 in) in length.It has a soft whistling call: wheeeeuuu.


== Folklore ==
In Costa Rica, its local common name is the rualdo. There is a legend of how this bird used to have a wonderful singing voice, but offered that to the volcano Po√°s to prevent a young woman from having to be sacrificed, thus keeping the volcano from erupting.
