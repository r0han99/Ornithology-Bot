Israeli pita, also known as pitot, Israeli pitta, or simply pita, is the Israeli version of pita flatbread that is commonly served with hummus and other dips, or as a sandwich bread stuffed with sabich, falafel, chicken schnitzel, shawarma, or other fillings. Israeli pita is commonly found in Israel, as well as in the United States, and at restaurants offering Jewish and Israeli cuisine worldwide.


== Overview ==

“Anyone who has been to Israel or any Israeli restaurant with house-made pita knows what I’m talking about — a thick, spongy, warm little loaf that has a perfectly sized pocket that maintains its composure as you stuff it full of falafel.”


=== Differences from other flatbreads and pitas ===

Israeli pita is different from other flatbread and pitas in several ways. Israeli pita is generally softer, thicker and doughier than other flatbreads, and it always contains a pocket. Israeli pita is generally thicker than other pitas. Many Arab and Greek pitas are not as soft as Israeli pita, and are typically thinner or do not contain a pocket. The pocket of the pita has “thick walls”, which are unique to Israeli pita, and help Israeli pita be sturdy enough for its signature fillings such as sabich, falafel, shawarma and chicken schnitzel, among others.


=== Texture ===

Israeli pita has a soft, fluffy, texture that has been described as pillowy and is traditionally served fresh from the oven (typically a wood-fired oven similar to a pizza oven).


== Serving ==

Israeli pita is traditionally served fresh, best either after baking or on the same day, and is served warm.


== Use ==

Israeli pita is served fresh, warm, and toasted for use in a variety of sandwiches, such as falafel, sabich, chicken schnitzel, shawarma, brik, and many more. As well as with a wide array of dips such as hummus, baba ghanoush, muhammara, zhoug, salat turki, ikra and even just with olive oil. It is also traditionally served in Israel as part of an Israeli breakfast, as well as with shakshouka or menemen. It is commonly served with eggs for breakfast. It is also sometimes served with cottage cheese.


== Popularity ==

Israeli pita is one of, if not the most popular bread in Israel. It is an essential part of Israeli cuisine, and can be served for every meal and every occasion, and can be found on the menu at most restaurants, bakeries, market stalls, and food trucks across Israel. As it contains no animal products, it is inherently pareve and can be served with fleishig or milchig meals accordingly by to kashrut.


== In popular culture ==
