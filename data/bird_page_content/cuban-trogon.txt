The Cuban trogon or tocororo (Priotelus temnurus) is a species of bird in the family Trogonidae. It is endemic to Cuba, where it is also the national bird. Its natural habitats are dry forests, moist forests, and heavily degraded former forest.


== Naming ==
In English the bird is commonly known as the Cuban trogon, while in Spanish, it is referred to as the tocororo or tocoloro. This local name is onomatopoeic, and was derived from its repeated call, "toco-toco-tocoro-tocoro".


== Description ==
The Cuban trogon is very colorful with a green back, blue crown, red belly and beak, and white throat and chest. Its colors are similar to the ones on the Cuban flag, which is why it was chosen to be the national bird of Cuba. It has a long fluffy tail which is unique amongst trogons. From beak to tail, this bird is between ten and eleven inches. In flight, they travel in pairs creating a large amount of noise because of their rough, graceless flying technique. The birds don't domesticate well and will often die if caged.


== Habitat ==
The Cuban trogon is very common and can be found all over the island of Cuba. The only places it is rare to see the bird is on the Isle of Youth, Guajaba, Romano, and Sabinal. They prefer wet and dry forests of all altitudes and like to be in the shade as opposed to the sun. The Cuban trogon nests in already created crevices in trees, primarily abandoned woodpecker holes, and feeds on flowers, fruits and insects. Unlike most birds, it is capable of hovering while eating.
