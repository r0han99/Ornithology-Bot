The Enggano hill myna or Enggano myna (Gracula enganensis) is a member of the starling family. It is an endemic resident of Enggano Island, off southwest Sumatra.


== Description ==
The Enggano hill myna is stocky with mainly black plumage. It has bright orange-yellow patches of naked skin and fleshy yellow wattles on the side of its head and nape. At about 27 centimetres (11 in) in length, it is somewhat smaller than the common hill myna.
It has overall turquoise-glossed black plumage, purple-tinged on the head and neck. There are large white wing patches which are obvious in flight. The thick bill and strong legs are bright yellow.


== Behaviour ==
The bird is arboreal and is found mainly along forest edges. Like most starlings, the Enggano hill myna is fairly omnivorous, eating fruit, nectar and insects.
